Example routines for extracting metrics from a PostGIS database of building polygons.

## Description
This repository contains example SQL queries for extracting metrics about buildings from a PostGIS database. It aims to show how a database can be used to determining attributes on the form and geometry of 2D building footprints. It as been tested on OS MasterMap Topography Layer data.

### Built form extraction and exterior wall ratio
In the code, a PostGIS schema.table `derivedinfo.buildingsandheights` contains the building footprints (MasterMap) footprints which have been spatially joined to  a dataset of address points (AddressBase). A PostGIS topology has been defined over `derivedinfo.buildingsandheights`. 

 - The query `built_form_classification.sql` shows adding a field `form_based_on_addressgeometry` defining the built form (i.e. detached | semi-detached | mid-terrace | end-terrace | complex).
 
 - The query `compute_exterior_wall_ratio_normal_tables.sql` shows creation of a table `derivedinfo.external_wall_ratio_test`  containing the length of exterior edges, the length of shared edges and the external wall ratio.
